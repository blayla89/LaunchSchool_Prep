// 5. What happens if we take the array ['fish', 'and', 'chips'] and try to access the element at index position 10? Try this in your JavaScript console.

console.log(['fish', 'and', 'chips'][10])

// undefined - JS doesn't throw an error when we try to access an element beyond its last index position -> returns undefined instead
