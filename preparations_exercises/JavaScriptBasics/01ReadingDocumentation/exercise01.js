// 1. What is an excellent destination when looking for JavaScript documentation?

/*
  MDN = great resource
    - includes JS, HTML, CSS, etc. 
    - caveat -> crowd-sourced so ambiguity and/or inaccuracies can be introduced
    JS Standards = holy grail = source-code
      - study and use when you really need to be sure
