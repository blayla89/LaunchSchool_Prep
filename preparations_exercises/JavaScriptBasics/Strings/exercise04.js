// 4. Take the following rhyme:

  /*
    A pirate I was meant to be!
    Trim the sails and roam the sea!
  */

  // How can you assign this string to a single variable, preserving the line break?

// 1. Escape notation - use newline character (\n) -----------------------------------------
let escapeNotation = 'A pirate I was meant to be!\nTrim the sails and roam the sea!'; 
console.log(escapeChar);

// 2. template literal notation - supports multi-line strings ------------------------------
let templateLiteral = `A pirate I was meant to be!
Trim the sails and roam the sea!`; 
console.log(templateLiteral);
